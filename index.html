 <p class=""><p>I love to go to school. When I have a holiday I miss school. I go to school with my friends, and we enjoy biking down together. My school is two kilometers away from home. I wake up early in the morning to go to school as classes begin at quarter past seven every day.

I find my school uniform very smart. The uniform is a white shirt and a blue skirt with a black belt and blue tie. And to go with it is a pair of white socks and black shoes. The teachers are strict about our uniform being neat and spotlessly clean. At the assembly the students, all together, look very neat and well turned out.
<br>
At school I learn many new things each day. There are many subjects that are taught to us like languages, mathematics, science and social studies. We also have interesting co-curricular activities that help us learn better. We also go on educative excursions.
<br>
There are a number of extra-curricular activities also that are offered to us. We are afforded opportunities to participate in various sports, music, dance, theatre and art events. These are fun activities that also help us develop our hobbies.
